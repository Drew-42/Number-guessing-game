# Number-guessing-game
The user must guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100. After each incorrect guess, the script will point out to the user if their choice is higher or lower than the correct number, as a hint. At the end, the number of total guesses is displayed, enabling the user to evaluate their performance (the lower the better).
I wrote this script to practice using the random module.
